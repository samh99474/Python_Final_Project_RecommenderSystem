## Introduction ##
<br />Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world.
<br />The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. 
<br />Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. 
<br />Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual.

<br />We build a movie recommender system in python, and then our recommender system consists of the basic 3 methods.
<br />1. Content-Based Filtering
<br />2. Collaborative Filtering
<br />3. Hybrid
<br />The movie dataset is from Kaggle, and we convert the original CSV file to DB file so that we can process the data in SQLite

<br />As for GUI, we use pyqt6 to show the Socket Client interface(DB and RS is in Socket Server).
<br />Therefore User (client) can send a command to the server to request Movie information, user information, recommendation output list, and so on.
